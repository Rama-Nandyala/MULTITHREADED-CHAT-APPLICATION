##The Multithreaded Chat Application, developed using Java in the IntelliJ IDEA environment, is a client-server based real-time communication system designed to allow multiple users to exchange messages concurrently. At its core, the application utilizes Java Sockets to establish a reliable network connection between clients and a central server, and it employs multithreading to handle simultaneous client interactions without conflict or delay. The server component listens on a predefined port for incoming client connections and, upon connection, creates a new dedicated thread for each client. This threading mechanism ensures that each user operates independently, enabling real-time bidirectional communication. The server maintains a list of all active clients and uses this list to broadcast incoming messages from one client to all others. This approach mimics real-world chat applications where users can participate in group conversations. On the client side, the application is also multithreaded: one thread is responsible for capturing user input and sending messages to the server, while another listens for incoming messages from the server and displays them. This dual-threaded approach prevents blocking operations and provides a seamless chatting experience. The user interface, though console-based in this implementation, allows clear and continuous messaging without interruption. The system architecture promotes scalability, allowing additional clients to connect without degrading performance or communication speed. The development of this project demonstrates key Java concepts such as socket programming, thread management, synchronization, exception handling, and stream-based input/output, making it a valuable learning experience for understanding how networking and concurrent programming work in real-world scenarios. Beyond its technical implementation, the project serves a practical purpose by simulating the core functionality of modern instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, or Microsoft Teams at a basic level. It emphasizes the importance of efficient server-side thread handling to maintain high availability and responsiveness in multi-user environments. The use of IntelliJ IDEA as the development environment allowed for smooth code writing, debugging, and testing of both server and client components. The successful implementation of this application fulfills the given internship instructions by CodTech, which required building a working client-server chat application using Java Sockets and multithreading to manage multiple users. The final deliverable—a functional chat application supporting real-time interaction among several clients—demonstrates a strong understanding of network communication principles and concurrent programming in Java. This project not only met all technical objectives but also provided insight into how distributed systems operate in practice. It has equipped the developer with hands-on experience in managing socket connections, thread lifecycles, message broadcasting, and synchronization, all of which are crucial skills for any software engineer working with network-based applications. Upon the successful completion of this project and internship, the developer is eligible to receive a completion certificate from CodTech on the internship’s designated end date.
